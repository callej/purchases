A database program created with the help of ChatGPT using GPT-4. 

There were a lot of issues along the way, and it does require some programming skills to make it work. But a lot of the generated code is excellent. 

One of the major issues was the frequently upcoming error: `network error`. This happens in the middle of the responses. You have to generate the response again and then you soon have filled your cap with no information receive. This means that you have to wait for 3 hours before you can continue. It becomes pretty inefficient, but I am still impressed about the final result.
